# Debtor Management System

## Overview

This project is developed using Spring Boot and Clean Architecture, focuses on managing debtor information. The main goal of the project is to enhance my skills in unit testing with Java, while also integrating several modern DevOps tools, including GitHub Actions, Dependabot, SonarQube, and Prometheus for continuous integration, dependency management, code quality, and monitoring.

## Objectives

- Learn and implement unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
- Set up and automate CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- Utilize Dependabot for automated dependency updates.
- Integrate SonarQube for code quality and security analysis.
- Use Prometheus for monitoring and metrics collection.
